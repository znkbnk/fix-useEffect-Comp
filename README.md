This project is designed to help
coders practice their React skills
by providing code snippets with
intentional mistakes that they
can fix, particularly focusing
on understanding and utilizing
the useEffect hook effectively,
enabling them to gain hands-on 
experience in debugging and
enhancing React components.

Mistake 1: Add import statements
for useState, and useEffect.

Mistake 2: Capitalize the component
name to follow React component
naming conventions.

Mistake 3: Initialize the count
state with the initial value.

Mistake 4: Remove the count update
inside the first useEffect hook 
to avoid an infinite loop.

Mistake 5: Create the console.log
statement inside the second useEffect
hook to track the count update.

Mistake 6: Add missing dependency
in the second useEffect hook.

Mistake 7: Capitalize the component
name to follow React component naming
conventions in the export statement.
